WIP! This repository contains code for the paper "Task-driven hierarchical deep neural networkmodels of the proprioceptive pathway", by Kai J Sandbrink, Pranav Mamidanna, Claudio Michaelis, Mackenzie W Mathis, Matthias Bethge and Alexander Mathis.

The code is organized as follows:
1. Dataset Generation. (Proprioceptive Character Recognition = PCR Dataset) Code can be found in `dataset`
2. Solving the PCR Dataset using binary SVMs. Code can be found in `svm-analysis`
3. Solving the PCR Dataset using various network models. Code in `nn-training`
4. Representational Similarity of the models. Code in `repr-analysis`
5. Single Unit tuning curves. (WIP)

Note: `code` : contains all code as .py files used at one/more places in the analyses.
