**This folder contains all code required to train SVM models on the PCRT dataset.**  

* `MakeSVMDatasets.ipynb` and `binarysvm.py` describe how SVMs were trained on the PCRT dataset and its augmentation suppressed counterparts.
* `Figure3_MulticlassSVM` and `Figure3_PairwiseSVM` gather performance numbers from all SVM models and produce Figures 3B and 3C from the study.
